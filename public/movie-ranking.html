    <h1>The Best Series According to Baruk</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 series of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Gravity Falls</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite animation. Such a fantastic lore.</p>
    <h3>JoJo's Bizarre Adventures</h3>
    <p>I can't even describe this, all i can say is: <i>"Di Molto"</i></p>
    <h3>Serial Experiments Lain</h3>
    <p>At first you won't understand a thing, in the end you'll feel like how you started. But it's good, trust me.</p>
